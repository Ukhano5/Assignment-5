Q1: Predominant representational structures in graphs include adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. Visual distinctions often involve matrix grids or linked node diagrams. These choices impact understanding by influencing ease of traversal and memory efficiency.

Q2: A graph becomes a tree when it's acyclic and connected, meaning no cycles (loops) exist, and there's a unique path between any two nodes. Trees have n-1 edges for n nodes. Differentiating factors include connectivity and absence of cycles.

Q3: Bubble sort's efficiency varies:
- Best case: O(n) when pre-sorted, minimal swaps.
- Average case: O(n^2), as it compares and swaps elements.
- Worst case: O(n^2) when in reverse order. Inefficient due to repeated passes and swaps.

Q4: Selection sort selects the minimum element in each pass and swaps it with the element in the current position. Key principles involve finding the minimum and swapping, gradually sorting the array.

Q5: Selection sort conceptually involves finding the minimum element and placing it in the correct position. It iterates through the array, making swaps. It's less efficient than some algorithms (O(n^2)), but its simplicity suits small datasets. Other algorithms may offer better efficiency for larger datasets.
